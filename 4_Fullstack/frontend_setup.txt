First we create a client folder with:
npx create-react-app client --use-npm

Now normally we could fetch to
http://127.0.0.1:5555/path
but we can simpify this with adding this to package.json
"proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5555"
also make sure we are running our client on a different port
"scripts": {
  "start": "PORT=4000 react-scripts start"
}
Now make sure to do an npm start in the client folder
